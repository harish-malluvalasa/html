    <p>This quote is widely attributed to <cite>Albert Einstein.</cite></p>
    <p>In literary studies, it's essential to cite sources properly. For example, if you're referencing a famous work like <cite>Pride and Prejudice</cite><br>
by Jane Austen, you should always include the author's name to give proper credit.</p>
